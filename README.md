# Stock Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide Steven with investment data as the stocks his parents were trying to purchase had a -63% return.
We provided the new information by refactoring the original code, while improving its efficiency and making it easier to read and understand.

### Results
We were presented with 12 different stocks’ data containing their ticker value, the date the stock was issued, their opening, closing and their adjusted price at closing time. The objective was to analyze the data to obtain the daily volume and their return, so that we could provide investment advice to Steven’s parents.

See below for the code we used.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general.

-	I think one of the advantages of refactoring code in general is that we can reuse an already existent code and make it, so it fits our needs.
-	Another advantage of refactoring code is that it makes our code cleaner, well organized and it could make it run faster.
-	It takes time to refactor code in general, and one must consider if it is worth the time and money to even refactor it.
-	Also, if done incorrectly, you can make things more complicated.  

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script.
-	I think the biggest advantage was the decrease in macro run time as the original analysis took over a second to run, and our refactored took 0.19 seconds, almost a fourth of the origina time. 
-	In this case, I do not see any disadvantages in refactoring the original VBA code, as the original purpose was met, and it improved the code.
